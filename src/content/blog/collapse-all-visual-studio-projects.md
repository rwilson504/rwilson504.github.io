Tired of opening up a Visual Studio Solution and having to deal with collapsing all the project manually.  Check out PowerCommands, it's free and offer these additional features.  
  
Visual Studio 2008: <http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands>  
Visual Studio 2010: <http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e5f41ad9-4edc-4912-bca3-91147db95b99>  
  
**Enable/Disable PowerCommands in Options dialog**  
  
This feature allows you to select which commands to enable in the Visual Studio IDE. Point to the Tools menu, then click Options. Expand the PowerCommands options, then click Commands. Check the commands you would like to enable.  
  
Note: All power commands are initially defaulted Enabled.  
  
**Format document on save / Remove and Sort Usings on save**  
The Format document on save option formats the tabs, spaces, and so on of the document being saved. It is equivalent to pointing to the Edit menu, clicking Advanced, and then clicking Format Document. The Remove and sort usings option removes unused using statements and sorts the remaining using statements in the document being saved.  
  
Note: The Remove and sort usings option is only available for C# documents.  
  
Note: Format document on save and Remove and sort usings both are initially defaulted OFF.

**Copy Path**  
This command copies the full path of the currently selected item to the clipboard. It can be executed by right-clicking one of these nodes in the Solution Explorer:  
  
The solution node; A project node; Any project item node; Any folder.

**Undo Close**  
This command reopens a closed document , returning the cursor to its last position. To reopen the most recently closed document, point to the Edit menu, then click Undo Close. Alternately, you can use the CtrlShiftZ shortcut.  
  
To reopen any other recently closed document, point to the View menu, click Other Windows, and then click Undo Close Window. The Undo Close window appears, typically next to the Output window. Double-click any document in the list to reopen it.  
  
**Collapse Projects**  
This command collapses a project or projects in the Solution Explorer starting from the root selected node. Collapsing a project can increase the readability of the solution. This command can be executed from three different places: solution, solution folders and project nodes respectively.  
  
**Copy Class**  
This command copies a selected class entire content to the clipboard, renaming the class. This command is normally followed by a Paste Class command, which renames the class to avoid a compilation error. It can be executed from a single project item or a project item with dependent sub items.  
  
**Paste Class**  
This command pastes a class entire content from the clipboard, renaming the class to avoid a compilation error. This command is normally preceded by a Copy Class command. It can be executed from a project or folder node.  
  
**Copy References**  
This command copies a reference or set of references to the clipboard. It can be executed from the references node, a single reference node or set of reference nodes.  
  
**Paste References**  
This command pastes a reference or set of references from the clipboard. It can be executed from different places depending on the type of project. For CSharp projects it can be executed from the references node. For Visual Basic and Website projects it can be executed from the project node.  
  
**Copy As Project Reference**  
This command copies a project as a project reference to the clipboard. It can be executed from a project node.  
  
**Edit Project File**

**Reload Projects**
