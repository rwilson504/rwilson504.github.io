# bd_warehouse — Parametric Part Library for build123d

> **Prerequisite:** Load `cad-build123d-general` first — bd_warehouse parts
> are returned as build123d `Part` objects and follow the same API conventions.

## Purpose

Before modeling a common mechanical component from scratch, check whether
`bd_warehouse` already provides a parametric version. It is the
most-comprehensive build123d-native part library, written by the build123d
author (Gumyr), and covers the vast majority of "I need a standard part"
requests an agent will see.

This skill is the **bd_warehouse reference**. The `Other build123d-compatible
libraries` appendix at the end points to a handful of niche libraries
(py_gearworks for advanced gears, bd_vslot for V-Slot rails, etc.) and the
separate `cad-partcad-repository` skill for the wider community-parts
catalog.

## When to Use This Skill

- The user asks for a **bolt, screw, nut, washer, bearing, simple gear,
  sprocket, pipe, flange, helical thread, or heat-set insert hole**.
- The user says *"is there already a part for …?"* or *"I don't want to
  model X from scratch"*.
- You're about to hand-model a standard mechanical component — check here
  first.
- Need an *advanced* gear (helical, bevel, cycloid, profile shift, backlash
  control)? Bounce out to py_gearworks via the appendix below.
- Need a community part that isn't on bd_warehouse (e.g. an OpenVMP robot
  arm, a piece of furniture)? Bounce out to `cad-partcad-repository`.

## Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/gumyr/bd_warehouse
```

> ⚠️ Install from git — `bd_warehouse` is not currently published to PyPI.
> The git source tracks build123d's API closely; pinning a commit is wise
> for reproducibility.

## Fastener Quick Reference

### Discovering available parts

```python
from bd_warehouse.fastener import Nut, HexNut, Screw, SocketHeadCapScrew

# List all nut subclasses
Nut.__subclasses__()

# List types for a class
HexNut.types()          # {'iso4033', 'iso4032', 'iso4035'}

# List sizes for a type
HexNut.sizes("iso4032") # ['M1.6-0.35', 'M2-0.4', ..., 'M48-5']

# Find all fasteners that come in M6
Nut.select_by_size("M6-1")
Screw.select_by_size("M6-1")
```

### Creating fasteners

```python
from build123d import *
from bd_warehouse.fastener import HexNut, SocketHeadCapScrew, SetScrew

nut       = HexNut(size="M3-0.5", fastener_type="iso4032")
screw     = SocketHeadCapScrew(size="M6-1", fastener_type="iso4762", length=16)
setscrew  = SetScrew(size="M6-1", fastener_type="iso4026", length=10 * MM)

# Imperial sizes work too
cap_screw = SocketHeadCapScrew(
    size="#6-32", fastener_type="asme_b18.3", length=(1/2) * IN
)
```

### Custom holes (the real power feature)

```python
from bd_warehouse.fastener import (
    ClearanceHole, TapHole, InsertHole, HeatSetNut, SocketHeadCapScrew,
)

screw = SocketHeadCapScrew(size="M2-0.4", length=16)

with BuildPart() as block:
    Box(50, 50, 10)
    with Locations((0, 0, 10)):
        # Clearance hole sized to the screw — no manual dimensions needed
        ClearanceHole(fastener=screw, fit="Normal")

# For 3D-printed heat-set inserts
insert = HeatSetNut(size="M3-0.5-Standard", fastener_type="McMaster-Carr")
with BuildPart() as post:
    Cylinder(radius=5, height=10)
    with Locations((0, 0, 10)):
        InsertHole(fastener=insert)
```

### Pillow block example (bearing + fasteners)

```python
import copy
from bd_warehouse.bearing  import PressFitHole, SingleRowDeepGrooveBallBearing
from bd_warehouse.fastener import ClearanceHole, SocketHeadCapScrew
from build123d import *

cap_screw = SocketHeadCapScrew(size="M2-0.4", length=16, simple=False)
bearing   = SingleRowDeepGrooveBallBearing(size="M8-22-7")

with BuildPart() as pillow_block:
    with BuildSketch():
        RectangleRounded(50, 30, 2)
    extrude(amount=10)
    with Locations((0, 0, 10)):
        PressFitHole(bearing=bearing, interference=0.025 * MM)
        with GridLocations(38, 18, 2, 2):
            ClearanceHole(fastener=cap_screw)
```

> See `cad-build123d-printed-threads` for the FDM-printable patterns,
> the `interference` parameter, the `end_finishes` length-overrun gotcha,
> the algebra-fuse vs Compound multi-body trade-off, and the bugs that
> bite trapezoidal-thread `Mode.SUBTRACT` operations.

## Performance Tip

All fastener classes accept `simple=True` (default) which omits thread
geometry for dramatically faster rendering. Only set `simple=False` for
final renders or assembly validation.

## Other build123d-compatible part libraries

Brief pointers to libraries that handle niches `bd_warehouse` does not.
Listed here so the agent has the catalog in one place; load the linked
external docs for full API details.

### py_gearworks (advanced gears)

By GarryBGoode. Use this when `bd_warehouse.gear` isn't enough.

| Capability | bd_warehouse `gear` | py_gearworks |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Spur | ✓ | ✓ |
| Helical | limited | ✓ |
| Bevel | ✗ | ✓ |
| Cycloid | ✗ | ✓ |
| Profile shift | ✗ | ✓ |
| Backlash control | ✗ | ✓ |
| `mesh_to(other)` positioning | ✗ | ✓ |

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/GarryBGoode/py_gearworks
```

```python
from py_gearworks import SpurGear

g1 = SpurGear(number_of_teeth=12, module=2, height=4, profile_shift=0.3)
g2 = SpurGear(number_of_teeth=23, module=2, height=4)
g1.mesh_to(g2, target_dir=UP, backlash=0.1, angle_bias=1)

part_1 = g1.build_part()  # build123d Part
part_2 = g2.build_part()
```

Docs: <https://gggears.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

**Rule of thumb:** Use `bd_warehouse` for sprockets and simple gears
alongside fasteners. Use `py_gearworks` for anything with profile shift,
bevel gears, helical meshing, or backlash control.

### bd_vslot (V-Slot 2020 linear motion)

By James Keal. V-Slot 2020 rails, wheels, sliding T-nuts, end caps, build
plates, common bearings (625, 688, 105).

```bash
pip install bd-vslot
```

Docs: <https://bd-vslot.readthedocs.io/>

### bd_beams_and_bars (structural sections)

By ExperimentsLabs. Flat bars, IPE/HEA/HEB/HEM/IPN beams, L bars,
rectangle/round tubes, T bars, UPE/UAP/UPN beams.

```bash
pip install git+https://gitlab.com/experimentslabs/3d/bd_beams_and_bars.git
```

```python
from bd_beams_and_bars.profiles.flat_bars import Bar, Standards, Definition

part   = Bar(Standards.LFL.LFL_160x5, 500)
custom = Bar(Definition(w=43, h=9), 500)
```

Docs: <https://bd-beams-and-bars.3d.experimentslabs.com/>

> For round pipes specifically, `bd_warehouse.pipe` is usually a better
> fit — NPS-standard parametric pipes with joints.

### Superellipses & superellipsoids

By fanf2. Single-file Python module, not a pip package — copy
[`superellipse.py`](https://github.com/fanf2/kbd/blob/model-b/keybird42/superellipse.py)
into your project. Smooth alternative to rounded rectangles, useful for
typeface-style key caps, app-icon-style clipping, organic phone-case
shapes.

### Public PartCAD repository

A package-manager-style ecosystem with hundreds of community-published
parts and assemblies (electrical, electromechanics, electronics,
furniture, medical, robotics, std, storage). Includes bd_warehouse parts,
plus much more. Browse: <https://partcad.org/repository>.

> **Don't use this skill for PartCAD specifics.** The
> [`cad-partcad-repository`](../cad-partcad-repository/SKILL.md) skill
> covers `pip install partcad`, `pc.get_part_build123d(...)`, the
> CLI, and the AI-generated-part workflow. This entry is here only as
> a pointer.
