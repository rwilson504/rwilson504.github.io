"""cad_print_3mf.py — mode-aware .3mf export for build123d projects.

Companion to `cad-build123d-general`'s `export_with_reference()` STL helper.
Mirrors the design / test / production EXPORT_MODE workflow into Bambu-ready
.3mf output.

Usage in a project script:

    from cad_print_3mf import export_3mf_for_mode

    # After (or instead of) export_with_reference(part, stl_path, ...)
    export_3mf_for_mode(
        part,
        stl_path=stl_path,
        export_mode=EXPORT_MODE,
        bed_face=BED_FACE,
        axis_ref_block=ref_block_or_None,
    )

The .3mf is written next to the STL with the same stem and `.3mf` extension.
Behaviour by mode:

  - design:     part + axis_ref_block (if provided) added as separate
                objects in the .3mf so a slicer preview shows both.
  - test:       part only (the on-part wall labels from cad-build123d-general
                §8a survive in the mesh; no cube clutter).
  - production: part only.

All modes embed `cad_print_3mf_mode` and related metadata so a human
inspecting the file (or a future tool) can see which export mode produced
it.

This is a v1 BARE 3MF helper — the output has no slicer profile. To get
a profile-bearing print-ready file, drag the bare .3mf onto a template
.3mf in Bambu Studio (see `print-bambu-3mf` skill for how to save the
template).
