## Materials Compatibility

The P2S enclosure + adaptive airflow handles a broader material range than the P1S.

| Material | Recommended? | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **PLA** | ✅ Excellent | Adaptive airflow draws cool external air automatically — door does NOT need to be cracked open like on P1S |
| **PETG / PETG-CF** | ✅ Great | Strong layer adhesion; tune retraction for stringing |
| **ABS / ASA / ASA-CF** | ✅ Good | Internal circulation mode keeps chamber warm; ventilation outside printer required (fumes) |
| **PC** | ✅ Good | Needs dry filament; passive chamber limits part size |
| **PA / PA6-CF / PA6-GF / PAHT-CF / PPA-CF** | ✅ Supported | Dry filament critical; abrasive — use hardened nozzle |
| **TPU 95A+** | ⚠️ External spool only | Print from external spool holder, NOT through AMS |
| **TPU 85A / 90A** | ⚠️ Soft TPU | Use the [TPU 85A & 90A guide for P-series](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/filament-acc/filament/tpu-85a-90a-printing-guide-for-p-series) |
| **PVA / Support for PLA / Support for PETG / Support for ABS** | ✅ Via AMS | Soluble or breakaway support |
| **PLA-CF / PETG-CF / PET-CF / ABS-GF** | ✅ Hardened nozzle required | Stock nozzle is hardened steel; will wear faster than non-CF |
| **PPS-CF** | ❌ Not supported | Requires > 300 °C nozzle |

## Build Plates

| Plate | Best for | Don't use for |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Textured PEI (default)** | PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, CF/GF blends — general purpose | High-detail bottom-finish parts |
| **Smooth PEI** | Glossy bottom finish, PLA | PETG (sticks too well, can chip plate) |
| **Cool / Low-temp plate** | PLA only at 35–45 °C bed | Anything > 60 °C bed temp |
| **High-temp plate** | ABS, PA, PC | Overkill for PLA |

**Cleaning:** Isopropyl alcohol (>90%) before every print. Soap + warm water
weekly. Never touch the plate surface with bare fingers — skin oils kill
adhesion fast. **Do NOT scratch the silkscreen markers** on the heatbed —
the live camera uses them for position calibration.

**Compatibility:** P2S accepts all current Bambu 256mm build plates (X1C / P1S /
older P2S). Older plates without QR codes work but won't auto-identify; pick
"Ignore" or disable plate detection.

## AMS (Automatic Material System)

This user has the **AMS 2 Pro** (or original AMS — both work). The P2S Combo
includes AMS 2 Pro + buffer pre-installed.

### Required: Buffer
The P2S **requires a filament buffer** between the AMS and the printer. The
combo version includes it. Standalone P2S + standalone AMS = buy buffer
separately. The buffer:
- Smooths feed rate variations between AMS and extruder
- Detects entanglement (Hall sensor + spring-loaded slider)
- Y-channel design lets you switch AMS ↔ external spool without unplugging PTFE
- Has 2× 6-pin ports — only ONE for AMS at a time (other is spare/expansion)

### What the AMS does well
- Multi-color prints (up to 20 colors with 4× AMS 2 Pro + 4× AMS HT chained)
- Multi-material prints (model + soluble support)
- Auto filament identification (RFID-tagged Bambu spools)
- AMS 2 Pro: filament drying via 6-pin cable from printer (drying pauses printing)

### Quirks & limitations
- **No flexible filaments through AMS** — TPU jams in the AMS feed path.
  Use external spool holder for ALL TPU.
- **Original AMS works but needs a P2S-specific buffer adapter** (purchase
  separately).
- **AMS hub** (cascade adapter for X1/P1) is **NOT compatible** with P2S —
  different interface.
- **Drying multiple AMS 2 Pro units** requires Bambu power adapters
  (24V/4A 96W) for the additional units beyond the one connected to the printer.
- **Loading order** — slot 1 is closest to the AMS hub; if a filament must
  be primary, put it in slot 1 to minimize purge waste.
- **Third-party spools** — work fine, but no RFID. Configure manually in
  Bambu Studio per print.
- **Desiccant matters** — replace orange beads when they turn green. Wet
  PETG / ABS / Nylon prints poorly (popping, stringing, weak layers).

### AMS purge waste
Every filament change purges material to clear the previous color. Strategies:
- Put complex colors on the outside of the print (less inner-volume change)
- Use "flush into infill" and "flush into support" options
- Order colors in the slicer to minimize transitions

## Adaptive Airflow System (P2S-specific)

The P2S has **NO exhaust fan**. Instead it uses an adaptive airflow switching
unit that auto-selects between two modes based on filament:

| Mode | When | What happens |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Cooling mode** (low-temp filaments: PLA, PETG) | Auto | Adaptive switching unit draws cool external air into chamber. Hot air vents through back panel + purge wiper gaps. Lets you print PLA without cracking the door (when ambient < 30 °C). |
| **Heating mode** (high-temp: ABS, ASA, PC, PA) | Auto | Switching unit closes external intake. Air filter forms internal circulation loop. Heatbed + hotend warm chamber air. Activated carbon filter handles VOCs. |

**Implication:** Unlike the P1S, you generally **do NOT** need to crack the
door for PLA. The adaptive system handles it.

**Optional upgrade:** Auxiliary part-cooling fan slot on left side of chamber
— Bambu sells the kit. Worth installing for high-speed PLA/PETG with
overhangs.

## Calibration Routines

### Active flow calibration (P2S-exclusive)
Eddy current sensor in the toolhead enables **active flow calibration** during
print. Less manual flow tuning needed than P1S — but for new filaments,
still run:

### Before first print of a new filament
1. **Flow rate calibration** — Bambu Studio → Calibration → Flow rate. Run
   the dynamic flow test, pick the smoothest line, enter the modifier.
2. **Pressure advance** — Same menu. Critical for PETG and ABS to avoid
   corner blobs.
3. **Temperature tower** — Optional but recommended for unknown filaments.
   Picks the best layer adhesion vs. stringing trade-off.

### Periodic
- **Auto bed leveling (eddy sensor)** — runs at start of every print by
  default. Don't disable.
- **Vibration compensation** — runs at start of every print (the loud
  shaking sequence). Don't cancel — tunes input shaping for current
  machine state.
- **Z offset / first layer** — tune via Bambu Handy live tuning during the
  first layer of a known-good print. The eddy sensor handles auto-leveling
  but Z offset can drift after maintenance.
- **Bed tramming (manual)** — only required if eddy sensor flags a tilt
  out of compensation range. See [P2S Bed Tramming](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/p2s/maintenance/manual-bed-tramming).

## Maintenance Schedule

| Interval | Task |
|----------|------|
| Every print | Visual check of bed cleanliness; clear nozzle wipe pad |
| Weekly | Wipe build plate with soap + water; clean nozzle wipe pad |
| Monthly | Lubricate X/Y rods (Bambu-recommended grease ONLY — no WD-40); empty poop chute; clean buffer |
| Quarterly | Inspect belts (P2S has built-in belt-tension monitor — listen for prompts); check nozzle for clogs/wear; replace AMS desiccant; replace air filter activated carbon |
| Annually / as needed | Replace nozzle (sooner for abrasive CF/GF filaments — 3–6 months) |
| As needed | Firmware updates via Bambu Studio or Handy |

**P2S-specific:** Adjust the **eddy sensor** if Z calibration drifts — see
[Adjust P2S Nozzle Eddy Sensor](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/p2s/maintenance/adjust-the-eddy-sensor).

## Lessons Learned

> **Append every new lesson here as it's discovered.** Format:
> `### YYYY-MM-DD — Short title` followed by Symptom / Root Cause / Fix.

### 2026-04-24 — Persistent corner warping on large parts: rotate 45° on the bed

**Symptom:** A large flat-bottomed part keeps warping at the corners on the
P2S, even after all the standard warping fixes have been tried (clean plate,
correct bed temp for the material, brim, dry filament, closed door,
adaptive airflow in the correct mode for the material).

**Root cause (suspected):** Airflow path inside the P2S chamber and/or
heatbed thermal gradient is not perfectly uniform across the X/Y axes.
When a large part's edges are aligned with the X and Y axes, the corners
cool/warp asymmetrically.

**Fix:** **Rotate the part 45° around the Z axis** in Bambu Studio so its
edges run diagonal to the X/Y axes. This redistributes airflow and thermal
exposure across the part and usually eliminates the warp.

**Lesson:** When all the standard warping fixes have been tried on a large
part on the P2S, **try a 45° rotation before giving up or switching
materials.** Worth checking early on any part where one or more horizontal
dimension exceeds ~150 mm. If the 45° rotation fixes it, document the
orientation choice in the project's `decisions/` folder so it isn't
re-discovered next time.

## Quick Reference — Printer Failure Diagnosis

| Symptom | Likely cause | First fix to try |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| First layer won't stick anywhere | Dirty plate or wrong Z offset | Clean plate with IPA, run Z calibration |
| First layer sticks center, lifts corners | Bed temp too low or part too large w/o brim | Raise bed temp 5 °C, add brim |
| First layer pillowing / nozzle dragging | Z offset too low | Raise Z offset 0.02–0.04 mm via Bambu Handy live tuning |
| Layer shift mid-print | Belt slip, nozzle hit warped section, or vibration cal skipped | Don't cancel vibration cal; check belt-tension monitor reading |
| Stringing between parts | Retraction too low or material too wet | +0.2 mm retraction; dry filament; check AMS desiccant |
| Blobs at corners | Pressure advance not tuned | Run pressure advance calibration |
| Holes / under-extrusion | Partial nozzle clog or wet filament | Cold pull; dry filament |
| Top surface pillowing | Top-layer count too low or insufficient cooling | Bump top layers to 5+; check part cooling fan; install aux fan if persistent |
| **Persistent warping on large parts after all standard fixes** | **Asymmetric P2S airflow/thermal across X-Y aligned edges** | **Rotate part 45° around Z in slicer (see Lessons Learned)** |
| AMS misfeed during purge | Filament tip mangled from prior unload | Re-cut tip at 45°, reload |
| "Filament runout" but spool isn't out | Sensor false trigger (often PETG ooze) | Clean buffer + extruder filament-detection sensors |
| Z error code (0300 series) | Z motor / eddy sensor / lead screw issue | Run Z calibration; check eddy sensor adjustment; see [Bambu HMS code lookup](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/p2s/troubleshooting) |
| AI nozzle clumping detected | Heat blob building on nozzle | Pause and clean nozzle; reduce flow rate; check silicone sock for damage (yellow markers must be visible) |
| Spaghetti detection alert | Print failure (object detached or warped) | Don't override — investigate adhesion, supports, or part design |

EXAMPLE FORMAT (delete this comment block and replace with real lessons):

### 2026-04-30 — PETG corners lifted on textured PEI

**Symptom:** First two layers stuck fine, but corners of a 200mm-wide
flat-bottomed part lifted by layer 5, causing a wave on subsequent layers.

**Root cause:** Cool ambient (garage, ~16 °C). PETG shrinks more than PLA
during cooling; without a brim, edge stress overcame adhesion. Adaptive
airflow stayed in cooling mode (correct for PETG default) but ambient was
already cold, so chamber barely warmed.

**Fix:** Added 8mm brim. Manually closed adaptive intake (slicer setting:
"chamber temp control: closed"). Bed temp 80 °C → 85 °C. Issue resolved.

**Lesson:** For PETG over 150mm in any axis below 18 °C ambient, default
to brim and disable adaptive cool-air intake. Cross-reference: see
`print-bambu-studio` lesson on PETG adhesion settings.
