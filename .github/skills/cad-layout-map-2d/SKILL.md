description: 'Render a labeled 2D top-down (or side/front) layout map of a parametric build123d model from its FeatureRegistry, drawing every cavity, hole, cutout, and boss to scale on an outer-box outline with a north/south/east/west compass and color-coded annotations. USE FOR: "show me a layout diagram", "annotated top view", "where are the holes", "draw the layout", "schematic of the box", "diagram the compartments", verifying spatial intent before printing, communicating layout to the user.'

# CAD Layout Map (2D)

> **Prerequisite:** Load `cad-build123d-general` (for `ORIENTATION` and the
> design/test/production scaffold) and `cad-feature-inventory` (for the
> `FeatureRegistry` that this skill reads from). This skill is the visual
> sibling of the text-based feature inventory.

## Purpose

The text feature inventory tells you *what* features exist; the six-view
renders show the *finished mesh*. Neither answers "are these things
positioned where I think they are?" before you commit to a print.

This skill produces a **single, to-scale 2D PNG** showing the outer box
outline plus every registered feature, color-coded by type, with X/Y
coordinates and a compass overlay. It's drawn with `matplotlib`, so it
runs anywhere build123d already runs and renders in seconds.

Use it whenever:

- The user asks where things are spatially.
- You want to confirm a layout change visually without rebuilding the STL.
- You're explaining the model to someone who can't read the script.
- The text inventory is correct but two features look like they might
  collide and you want to *see* the clearance.

## Source of truth

This skill **consumes** the `FeatureRegistry` (`cad-feature-inventory`)
and the `ORIENTATION` map (`cad-build123d-general`). It does not invent
new coordinates — every shape it draws traces back to a registered
feature or to a script constant the layout map imports.

If a feature is on the model but not registered, it won't appear on
the map. That's the point: the map is a contract that says "these are
the features you told the script about."

## How it works

1. Create a sibling script next to your model: `layout_map.py`.
2. Import the model's parameters and helpers (`from your_model import ...`).
3. Read features from the registry. The registry is the single source
   of truth for what the map draws — both *positions* and *dimensions*
   come from each feature's record (`r["position"]`, `r["dimensions"]`).
   Named constants (`OUTER_W`, `OUTER_D`) are imported only for the
   outer-box outline, never for individual feature geometry.
4. Pick a projection plane: top (XY, looking down −Z), front (XZ,
   looking along −Y), or side (YZ, looking along −X).
5. Draw the outer-box outline, then one matplotlib patch per feature.
6. Annotate compass directions from `ORIENTATION` so the labels match
   what the user (and the feature inventory) calls each side.
7. Save to `exports/layout_<view>.png`.

The map is intentionally **not regenerated automatically by the model
script** — keep it as a separate runnable so it doesn't slow down every
rebuild. Run it after meaningful layout changes.

## Reference implementation

Drop this in a new file `layout_map.py` next to your model script.
Replace `your_model` with your actual module name and adjust the
parameter imports.

```python
"""Top-down labeled layout map of <project>.

Reads parameters and FeatureRegistry from <your_model>.py and draws a
to-scale top view PNG annotating every registered feature.

### Registry access

`FEATURES._records` is the simplest way to iterate, but if you'd
rather not touch a private attribute, add this small accessor to
`FeatureRegistry` once (it's backwards-compatible):

```python
def all(self):
    return list(self._records)
```

Then use `FEATURES.all()` in the layout map.

## Choosing the projection

| View | Axes drawn | When to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Top (XY)** | X horizontal, Y vertical, looking down −Z | Default. Best for trays, organizers, enclosures with everything reachable from above. |
| **Front (XZ)** | X horizontal, Z vertical, looking along −Y | Walls with cutouts, switch/jack panels, lid features that are seen from the front. |
| **Side (YZ)** | Y horizontal, Z vertical, looking along −X | Profile of stacked compartments, hinge axes, anything where Z layout matters more than X. |

You can have multiple layout scripts (`layout_top.py`, `layout_front.py`)
or one script that takes a `--view` flag. Start with one top view; add
others only when you actually need them.

## Grid spacing

**Lock both axes to a 10 mm major-tick grid** (`MultipleLocator(10)`).
Do NOT rely on matplotlib's auto-tick choice — it picks 25 or 50 mm at
typical 3D-print model sizes (50–250 mm), which is too coarse to read
clearances and wall thicknesses (typically 1.6–3 mm). 10 mm matches
how makers reason about printer-bed-sized parts and gives a usable
ruler against every gridline.

For very small parts (<30 mm overall) or very large parts (>500 mm),
adjust to 5 mm or 25 mm respectively, but the **default is 10 mm**.

## Color & shape conventions

- **Cavities** — translucent fill, solid outline, name in bold center.
- **Round holes / bosses** — translucent circle, short label inside.
- **Wall cutouts** — drawn as a thick colored bar on the edge of the
  outer box where the cut breaks through. Annotate above/below the bar.
- **Inside-bay features** (rod tabs, internal ribs) — small filled
  rectangles in a neutral grey so they don't fight with the cavity
  fills behind them.
- Pick **one color per feature type** (matching the keys in
  `COLOR_BY_TYPE`) and reuse it consistently between the inventory
  color hints (if any) and the map.

## Quick reference

| Symptom on the map | Likely cause | Fix |
|--------------------|--------------|-----|
| Feature missing from map | Not registered with `FEATURES.register(...)` | Add the registration immediately after building the feature. |
| Feature drawn at wrong place | `position` dict in the registry is stale | Recompute position with the same constants the model uses; don't hand-type. |
| Wall cutout drawn on the wrong edge | `face` in registration doesn't match `ORIENTATION` | Confirm which axis is `front`/`back`; the layout script reads from `ORIENTATION` directly. |
| Outer box outline doesn't match real outer dims | Imported wrong constant (e.g. `INNER_W` instead of `OUTER_W`) | Always import the *outer* footprint constants for the box outline. |
| Two features look like they collide | They actually do, OR the map is right and the model is wrong | Check the inventory positions; if they overlap there too, it's a real collision. |

## What this skill DOES NOT do

- It does not measure or query the geometry — it only visualizes what
  the registry says. If the registry is wrong, the map is wrong.
- It does not replace the `cad-build123d-six-view-checks` workflow.
  Six-views inspect the *mesh*; this map inspects the *intent*.
- It does not auto-detect feature types. The color map is a hand-tuned
  lookup keyed on the `type` strings you used in `FEATURES.register(...)`.
  Keep the type strings consistent across the project.

- `cad-build123d-six-view-checks` — rendered orthographic photos of the
  built mesh (visual sanity check on the *output*, not the *intent*).
- Working example: [`cad/soldering-station-organizer/layout_map.py`](../../cad/soldering-station-organizer/layout_map.py)
  produces [`exports/layout_top.png`](../../cad/soldering-station-organizer/exports/layout_top.png).
