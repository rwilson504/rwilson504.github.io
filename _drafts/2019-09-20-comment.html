So when youâ€™d write for example ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["StorageConnectionString"] somewhere in your application, that value would come directly from a secret in Key Vault. All without modifying anything in the actual source code of your app.<br /><br />I will also describe a more advanced scenario which will make your Web App integrated with Key Vault very easily redeployable into new environments.
